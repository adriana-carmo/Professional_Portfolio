        <br></br>
        <p>Hi, I am <b>Adriana Almeida</b>, software engineer with a degree in Software Engineering from FASP University in Brazil.</p>
        <p>Currently I am studying Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp at Columbia University to improve my skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, Node.js and other responsive web designs. I have been studying english since I arrived in the USA.</p>
        <p>In Brazil I worked as a software analyst supporting and maintaining the company's system using C# and SQL Server technologies. In 2016 to 2017 I moved to the Quality Assurance Software department, then starting to work with agile projects, which I accomplished the SCRUM Master certification.</p>
        <p>I am fascinated by party decorations for birthdays, specially children parties, wedding parties and I also enjoy my free time visiting cozy coffee shops.</p>
